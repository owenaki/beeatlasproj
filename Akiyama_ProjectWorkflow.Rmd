```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Proposed workflow:

Prompt user for either coordinates(in specific format) or ecosystem type

use Terrestrial Ecological Systems of the United States raster data for oregon <https://www.natureserve.org/products/terrestrial-ecological-systems-united-states>

If coordinates, use raster map to extract ecosystem data from around those coordinates. Get top 3 ecosystems from a buffer of some size

Use another data set from Nature Serve that maybe matches associated taxa in OBA data with an ecosystem. Might have to do some of this manually:

helpful page with data downloads: <https://www.natureserve.org/products/ecosystem-classification>

can make a master dataframe here with ecosystems in one column and taxas in another column

with ecosystems from desired area, pull smaller dataframe from OBA data with all associated taxas that grow well in the respective ecosystem.

Prompt user for either bee species or genus of interest

If there is not species of interest, list top 5 or 10 associated taxas with the most recorded bee interactions from that ecosystem.

take genus/species of interest and filter data to get top 5 or 10 taxas associated with that species

Can also test for taxas that have the most diverse associated bee taxa. If needed, can use simulation data to derive a measure of "robust-ness" as to return a plant system that makes for a resilient ecosystem.
